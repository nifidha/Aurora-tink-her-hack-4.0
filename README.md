# [Project Name] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Aurora]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Neha Ann Philip] - [NSS College Of Engineering, Palakkad]
- Member 2: [Nifidha K] - [NSS College Of Engineering, Palakkad]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://github.com/nifidha/Aurora-tink-her-hack-4.0.git]

### Project Description
Our project is a smart dictation-paced document reader that converts text into small spoken chunks with adjustable pauses, allowing users to copy notes comfortably at their own writing speed. It is designed to support students, people with eyesight difficulties, dyslexia, or other learning challenges by simulating a natural classroom dictation experience. The system also provides voice options, highlighting, and playback controls to make reading and writing more accessible and efficient.

### The Problem statement
Existing text readers are designed for listening, not writing, making it difficult for students and users with accessibility needs to copy notes at their own pace.

### The Solution
The problem is solved by developing a web app that converts text into small spoken chunks with adjustable pauses, allowing users to write comfortably at their own pace.

## Technical Details
The system is implemented as a web-based application that runs entirely in the browser, requiring no server-side processing for the core functionality. It follows a simple client-side architecture where user input, text processing, and speech synthesis are handled using JavaScript.

### Technologies/Components Used

**For Software:**
- Languages used: [e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS]
- Frameworks used: [e.g., React, Django, Spring Boot]
- Tools used: [e.g., VS Code, Git]

## Features

List the key features of your project:
- Feature 1: PDF-Based Text Input

Users can upload PDF files directly into the web application. The system extracts text from the document within the browser itself, eliminating the need for manual copy-paste and ensuring data privacy.
- Feature 2: Selective Dictation Control

The application allows users to select specific portions of text (by highlighting) from the uploaded content. Only the selected text is read aloud, enabling focused listening and efficient learning
- Feature 3: Customizable Dictation Settings

Users can control the number of words read at a time and set a delay between chunks. This helps adjust the reading pace based on individual comfort and comprehension levels
- Feature 4: Interactive Text-to-Speech Playback

The web app provides clear audio output with controls such as start, pause, resume, and repeat. The currently spoken text chunk is visually highlighted to improve user engagement and understanding.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:**[ChatGPT]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]


**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"
